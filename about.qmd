I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the Gemological Institute of America in New York studying diamond growth deep in earth's mantle. 
Previously I studied at earth Science at Columbia Universityâ€™s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. Prior to that background is as a microscopy and computed tomography specialist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

My research uses a suite of analytical methods and data processing routines to look at to study the chemistry of minerals formed deep in earth's mantle.
