Currently I am studying diamond growth from carbon rich fluids in earth's mantle. Diamonds are some of the only materials we have from the deep earth that are relatively unchanged during their journey to earth's surface. I study the fluid and mineral inclusions trapped in the diamond during its growth. These inclusions can tell us a lot about carbon transport deep in the earth.  

My Doctoral research at Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory focused on determining the water content of rocks from earth’s upper mantle. This is of crucial interest to scientists studying the material properties of tectonic plates and magma formation.

Previously I worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City where I specialized in electron microscopy and 3D analysis with x-ray computed tomography.
