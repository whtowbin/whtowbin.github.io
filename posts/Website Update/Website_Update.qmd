It has been a few years since I last updated my website. I have switched to a new static website generator called [Quarto](https://quarto.org) which should allow me to update my website more easily. It should allow me to share some of the data analysis and science I do everyday as well as share some of my photography.  

To finish things off here are some obligatory photos of my dog:
